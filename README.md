Late Antique Epistolography: Indexing and Mapping the Letters of Libanius

Libanius was a teacher of rhetoric during the fourth century AD whose school was in Antioch. He left behind an immense corpus composed of 64 orations, 51 declamations, 57 introductions to the speeches of Demosthenes, some school exercises and about 1544 letters. In the early 20th century, Richard Foerster made an edition of the whole of Libanius' work, which remains canonical to this day. After Foerster, editions and translations of the works of Libanius have been limited to a rather small number of cherry-picked orations and letters. While it is relatively simple to find your way through the orations (even if you have to consult more than 30 different editions/monographs to cover what has been worked on so far), the letters represent a more sizeable challenge, not only because there are about 1544 of them, but also because only about half of them have been edited or translated (with ample commentary ) since Foerster's canonical edition. To help scholars find their way through the corpus of letters, some scholars have made useful indexes for the letters on which they have worked. I believe this can be taken a step further.
